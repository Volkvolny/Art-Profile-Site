      <h3 class= "sacramento largeFont">Why Character Design?</h3>
      <p class= "merriweather mediumFont">My love for character design goes way back to when I was really young. I would easily become immersed in the fantasy worlds of cartoons, anime, and video games, it was fascinating to me.
        They never ceased to carry me through the difficult times and troubles growing up, and they were my gateway to meeting new people and friends. That fascination brought me into the realm of art.</p>
      <p class= "merriweather mediumFont">My personal goal since I started illustration and character design has always been to create unique characters that people would love and relate to, similar to how I connected with characters back then as a child,
        and even today. I've always found that people are much more immersed in stories and animations when they find a character who they can identify with, and as someone who lives so frequently in the fantasy worlds of anime in her art,
        I know how special those connections are.</p>
      <p class= "merriweather mediumFont">As I continue to delve further and further into my character design and illustrative passions, I strive to create those bonds between the viewer of an animation or the player of a video game, and the characters
        within those shows and games.</p>
